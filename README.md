# figma
learning UI/UX design with the Figma design tool


## Selection Concepts

selection is the bulk of the design process. This is selecting an object to be further designed/customized. 

The first thing to modify an object in figma is to select the object.

Two types of selection tools, and these work on any object in the design:

- move: 
    - selects objects in the design by clicking. You can confirm an object is selected by the highlighting around the edges of the object. Only when an object is selected in this way can it be designed (colored, edited, etc.).

Vector selection is an advanced use of selection, which happens when you have an object selected and then press the enter key. Vector mode allows for more customization of the selected object. You can alternate between vector and normal selection mode by pressing the enter key. You can also use the blue done button to transition between the selection modes as well.

having an object in normal selection mode has limited design features, but vector selection has more editing features.

The course will show when vector selection is necessary, and when normal selection mode is fine. 

## Shape Size

You can use the X,Y,W,H and rotational features in the design panel, or you can do this from the selection tool. 

There's also a corner radius property in this panel. There's also a way to make each corner of the shape independent in order to have various corner radii.

## Scale Tool

This is a selection tool under the pointer tab, and can resize the selected shape in proportional dimensions. 

The move tool can only increase sizes of the selection in one direction; the scale tool resizes all sides of the shape.

Use the delete button to remove objects from your canvas.

## Vector Selection Mode

This selection mode gives more circles you can manipulate to reform the shape. This is selecting individual vector points.

When you click on any point, the point will turn blue when it's selected, and you can add any property to that point. 

This allows you to play around with the vector points to make new and unique shapes.

To exit, vector mode hit enter.

### What Figma is For

Figma is great for rapid prototyping of websites and apps. Its the main tool of a UX/UI designer in the creation of wireframes and high fidelity mockups.

You can make something in Figma that's really great, with a lot of functionality to get into hands of clients and the intended audience, and they'd be able to use it enough to test out some theories about what users want and then things can be changed really quickly based on feedback.

It can get to the point where you get clients happy with the prototype. 

But Figma is just a prototyping tool. It may pass over some information, but it's not a lot of things that developers can use.

You could use these for a low-code/no-code website development. And using the figma mock up can be informative.

Figma is also being utilized directly for graphic designs outside of just applications. It's not good for printing graphics, but it could be used as like a mix of adobe illustrator and photoshop. but its made for designing websites and apps.

### UI vs UX

UI design: this is the user interface, this is the way things look.

UX design: how the objects are used. This is part of adding in functionality for the clients to review, and to gather information about whether or not the client likes the functionality as initially designed. 

The UX part takes design much further than just the layout.

## UI/UX Project Management

There should be an ask based on a persona, and a list of tasks that a workflow is meant to accomplish. 

A persona is the ideal customer that's being marketed to by the service, as well as an inclusion of the demographic the market is targeting. It helps to distance yourself from the design, to avoid designing things you enjoy personally. You don't want to design for yourself (because only you'd like it) and you want to avoid designing for everyone (because no one will love it). This is a middle ground, trying to get this early adopter persona to love it. 

A UX researcher will spend more time and gather documentation to understand Sarah a lot more than the simple one in the course.

### User and Task Flows

Instead of designing the entirety of a website, you can start by creating the flow for each of the features. The task flow can be several steps, and can build to be quite complicated. 

These processes could be the sign-up process, the sign-in process, the cancellation process, etc. Any of these features are considered the task flow. 

Task flows are different from user flows too, and may need more research to understand this difference. 

These tasks flows have intermediate steps that indicate the screens the user will see. The User flow will be more complicated because the user flow should include all possible steps to get to the screens being developed. 
    - this is like considering whether or not a person would use the search bar or a menu.
    - Its very much like a decision tree for getting to the end result of the task flow. 
    - the full layout of the ways in which the user can accomplish the task should be included in the user flow. 

Depending on the assignment, you may have to design a task flow for a mobile and desktop application. 

A UX/UI brief can be designing a whole website as well. 

The tough thing about a short client brief is that you may not get much direction from it, and need to have more information about their values and mission to help them find the right design to communicate those to their persona. This can be a good practice in having conversations with the stakeholders. 

There will be jobs at both ends -- too much info and too little info for designers. He suggests the designer really dive into who the designs are for and what they're meant to accomplish to get at the most compelling design. 

## Class project

This is my persona for the project:

Scooter TV

Your ideal customer is a man named Leo. Leo is in their 60â€™s and is married with no children. They have a masters degree and own a small business. Leo lives in Arlington, VA, has never brought anything similar to your product before and likes to have the latest tech.

The project at the end will have something unique to this project. Decided to turn to a character generator too to get something more interesting. 

Brittney Sullivan, 98, outgoing woman
Brittney is an outgoing woman who finds it hard to do the right thing. She has crazy, black hair. Her top quality is that she is particularly naughty. She has to save the world from killer a snake.

YOu can import the task flow too. 

## Wireframes vs Hi-Fi

Wireframes are basic templates for a website, whereas high fidelity mock-ups are more put together.

A Wireframe of a task flow can be created quickly, without concern about the detailed design elements. It can also be tested quickly. 

A Wireframe should have minimal colors, one or two at the most. It's not about the color at this point, just a way to talk about the general design elements and functionalities. 

You can take things a bit further with adding a font, designing more sketch like documents that you can test with.

Once these are done, you can build a hi-fi, beautiful mockup. 

## Introducing Frames

It starts with a blank canvas.

You can start by adding a frame to the project.

A frame is like a page or interface. You can draw the frame at any size. 

To get frames that are specific to a size, use the premade frames tools. You want to pick something close enough to the specifics of the job. You can google the most common phone and desktop size and start from there too. Can be useful to know the specs of the client's tech to make sure the mockup looks great on their devices. 

You can add multiple frames to a single project, you can move then to order the frames within the project file.

Recommended that you name each frame for the number of steps in the task flow. 

You can use versioning within the document as well as in the title of the figma project, or design file (a figma design file).

## The basics of Text and Fonts

There are two ways to make textboxes from the T tab:

- click box: this will allow for free text, with no box limits.
- click and drag box: this will form a box in which the text will be in, and will not adjust to the text.


Note: At the wireframe stage, make sure to keep all wording as simple as you can, so that the testing is focused, and the reviewers don't focus on the wrong things. 

Sometimes in Figma undo doesn't quite work effectively, so you want to make sure you select the object you want to undo when you hit the command.

If you are picking a font size, there are ways to get a preview of the font on the device screen to really judge this well. an alternative is to set the zoom of the design file to 100% before judging any font size. 

When doing wireframes pick the planest fonts you can thing of. The ones will little personality and are professional and have no brush script:

- Roboto is possibly the most generic to use. 
- Arial and Calibri are too microsoft-y to be seen as generic.


If you have it include the logo of the application in black and white in your wireframe. 

Do a bit of design in the wireframe, but not an excessive amount -- mainly this should include the object placement. 

## Rectangles, Circles, and Rounded Corners

You can use the rectangles and other shapes from the shapes menu. 

You can Layer shapes as well.

There are also shortcuts for several of these features that can be learned. 

There's also an arrange menu in the Figma file menu. You can use send forward and send backward. 

## Additional Notes

After watching for a bit, I left off taking notes for each section, and just followed the demo. This section will capture one off notes I could stand to remember.

- light blue or grey are good color choices for wireframes, along with black or white. Can add a single color just for popo if those are known for the client. 
- you can choose the formatting that the color are displayed in. These options include hexadecimal, css (rgba), and other options.
- There's an eyedropper tool for color as well. 
- There's also a document color tool that keeps references to all the colors used in the current project file. 
- There's a set default properties menu in the paid version of Figma, which can enable you to set a default for different shapes (i.e. whether or not they start with a border, what colors shapes start, etc.)
- You can copy properties from each shape and paster those properties onto another using the edit menu as well by using the figma menu or Control+shift+c and -v. 
- The shortcut control+D will redo the very last thing you did, which is really helpful when making multiple copies of the same shape.
- Remember that when you build an icon, you do this from 100% zoom, so that you get a sense of how big these icons will be on screen.
- The hamburger menu is also called a `nav sandwich`
