# figma
learning UI/UX design with the Figma design tool


## Selection Concepts

selection is the bulk of the design process. This is selecting an object to be further designed/customized. 

The first thing to modify an object in figma is to select the object.

Two types of selection tools, and these work on any object in the design:

- move: 
    - selects objects in the design by clicking. You can confirm an object is selected by the highlighting around the edges of the object. Only when an object is selected in this way can it be designed (colored, edited, etc.).

Vector selection is an advanced use of selection, which happens when you have an object selected and then press the enter key. Vector mode allows for more customization of the selected object. You can alternate between vector and normal selection mode by pressing the enter key. You can also use the blue done button to transition between the selection modes as well.

having an object in normal selection mode has limited design features, but vector selection has more editing features.

The course will show when vector selection is necessary, and when normal selection mode is fine. 

## Shape Size

You can use the X,Y,W,H and rotational features in the design panel, or you can do this from the selection tool. 

There's also a corner radius property in this panel. There's also a way to make each corner of the shape independent in order to have various corner radii.

## Scale Tool

This is a selection tool under the pointer tab, and can resize the selected shape in proportional dimensions. 

The move tool can only increase sizes of the selection in one direction; the scale tool resizes all sides of the shape.

Use the delete button to remove objects from your canvas.

## Vector Selection Mode

This selection mode gives more circles you can manipulate to reform the shape. This is selecting individual vector points.

When you click on any point, the point will turn blue when it's selected, and you can add any property to that point. 

This allows you to play around with the vector points to make new and unique shapes.

To exit, vector mode hit enter.

### What Figma is For

Figma is great for rapid prototyping of websites and apps. Its the main tool of a UX/UI designer in the creation of wireframes and high fidelity mockups.

You can make something in Figma that's really great, with a lot of functionality to get into hands of clients and the intended audience, and they'd be able to use it enough to test out some theories about what users want and then things can be changed really quickly based on feedback.

It can get to the point where you get clients happy with the prototype. 

But Figma is just a prototyping tool. It may pass over some information, but it's not a lot of things that developers can use.

You could use these for a low-code/no-code website development. And using the figma mock up can be informative.

Figma is also being utilized directly for graphic designs outside of just applications. It's not good for printing graphics, but it could be used as like a mix of adobe illustrator and photoshop. but its made for designing websites and apps.

### UI vs UX

UI design: this is the user interface, this is the way things look.

UX design: how the objects are used. This is part of adding in functionality for the clients to review, and to gather information about whether or not the client likes the functionality as initially designed. 

The UX part takes design much further than just the layout.

## UI/UX Project Management

There should be an ask based on a persona, and a list of tasks that a workflow is meant to accomplish. 

A persona is the ideal customer that's being marketed to by the service, as well as an inclusion of the demographic the market is targeting. It helps to distance yourself from the design, to avoid designing things you enjoy personally. You don't want to design for yourself (because only you'd like it) and you want to avoid designing for everyone (because no one will love it). This is a middle ground, trying to get this early adopter persona to love it. 

A UX researcher will spend more time and gather documentation to understand Sarah a lot more than the simple one in the course.

### User and Task Flows

Instead of designing the entirety of a website, you can start by creating the flow for each of the features. The task flow can be several steps, and can build to be quite complicated. 

These processes could be the sign-up process, the sign-in process, the cancellation process, etc. Any of these features are considered the task flow. 

Task flows are different from user flows too, and may need more research to understand this difference. 

These tasks flows have intermediate steps that indicate the screens the user will see. The User flow will be more complicated because the user flow should include all possible steps to get to the screens being developed. 
    - this is like considering whether or not a person would use the search bar or a menu.
    - Its very much like a decision tree for getting to the end result of the task flow. 
    - the full layout of the ways in which the user can accomplish the task should be included in the user flow. 

Depending on the assignment, you may have to design a task flow for a mobile and desktop application. 

A UX/UI brief can be designing a whole website as well. 

The tough thing about a short client brief is that you may not get much direction from it, and need to have more information about their values and mission to help them find the right design to communicate those to their persona. This can be a good practice in having conversations with the stakeholders. 

There will be jobs at both ends -- too much info and too little info for designers. He suggests the designer really dive into who the designs are for and what they're meant to accomplish to get at the most compelling design. 

## Class project

This is my persona for the project:

Scooter TV

Your ideal customer is a man named Leo. Leo is in their 60â€™s and is married with no children. They have a masters degree and own a small business. Leo lives in Arlington, VA, has never brought anything similar to your product before and likes to have the latest tech.

The project at the end will have something unique to this project. Decided to turn to a character generator too to get something more interesting. 

Brittney Sullivan, 98, outgoing woman
Brittney is an outgoing woman who finds it hard to do the right thing. She has crazy, black hair. Her top quality is that she is particularly naughty. She has to save the world from killer a snake.

YOu can import the task flow too.
