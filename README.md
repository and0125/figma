# figma
learning UI/UX design with the Figma design tool


## Selection Concepts

selection is the bulk of the design process. This is selecting an object to be further designed/customized. 

The first thing to modify an object in figma is to select the object.

Two types of selection tools, and these work on any object in the design:

- move: 
    - selects objects in the design by clicking. You can confirm an object is selected by the highlighting around the edges of the object. Only when an object is selected in this way can it be designed (colored, edited, etc.).

Vector selection is an advanced use of selection, which happens when you have an object selected and then press the enter key. Vector mode allows for more customization of the selected object. You can alternate between vector and normal selection mode by pressing the enter key. You can also use the blue done button to transition between the selection modes as well.

having an object in normal selection mode has limited design features, but vector selection has more editing features.

The course will show when vector selection is necessary, and when normal selection mode is fine. 

## Shape Size

You can use the X,Y,W,H and rotational features in the design panel, or you can do this from the selection tool. 

There's also a corner radius property in this panel. There's also a way to make each corner of the shape independent in order to have various corner radii.

## Scale Tool

This is a selection tool under the pointer tab, and can resize the selected shape in proportional dimensions. 

The move tool can only increase sizes of the selection in one direction; the scale tool resizes all sides of the shape.

Use the delete button to remove objects from your canvas.

## Vector Selection Mode

This selection mode gives more circles you can manipulate to reform the shape. This is selecting individual vector points.

When you click on any point, the point will turn blue when it's selected, and you can add any property to that point. 

This allows you to play around with the vector points to make new and unique shapes.

To exit, vector mode hit enter.

### What Figma is For

Figma is great for rapid prototyping of websites and apps. Its the main tool of a UX/UI designer in the creation of wireframes and high fidelity mockups.

You can make something in Figma that's really great, with a lot of functionality to get into hands of clients and the intended audience, and they'd be able to use it enough to test out some theories about what users want and then things can be changed really quickly based on feedback.

It can get to the point where you get clients happy with the prototype. 

But Figma is just a prototyping tool. It may pass over some information, but it's not a lot of things that developers can use.

You could use these for a low-code/no-code website development. And using the figma mock up can be informative.

Figma is also being utilized directly for graphic designs outside of just applications. It's not good for printing graphics, but it could be used as like a mix of adobe illustrator and photoshop. but its made for designing websites and apps.

### UI vs UX

UI design: this is the user interface, this is the way things look.

UX design: how the objects are used. This is part of adding in functionality for the clients to review, and to gather information about whether or not the client likes the functionality as initially designed. 

The UX part takes design much further than just the layout.

## UI/UX Project Management

There should be an ask based on a persona, and a list of tasks that a workflow is meant to accomplish. 

A persona is the ideal customer that's being marketed to by the service, as well as an inclusion of the demographic the market is targeting. It helps to distance yourself from the design, to avoid designing things you enjoy personally. You don't want to design for yourself (because only you'd like it) and you want to avoid designing for everyone (because no one will love it). This is a middle ground, trying to get this early adopter persona to love it. 

A UX researcher will spend more time and gather documentation to understand Sarah a lot more than the simple one in the course.

### User and Task Flows

Instead of designing the entirety of a website, you can start by creating the flow for each of the features. The task flow can be several steps, and can build to be quite complicated. 

These processes could be the sign-up process, the sign-in process, the cancellation process, etc. Any of these features are considered the task flow. 

Task flows are different from user flows too, and may need more research to understand this difference. 

These tasks flows have intermediate steps that indicate the screens the user will see. The User flow will be more complicated because the user flow should include all possible steps to get to the screens being developed. 
    - this is like considering whether or not a person would use the search bar or a menu.
    - Its very much like a decision tree for getting to the end result of the task flow. 
    - the full layout of the ways in which the user can accomplish the task should be included in the user flow. 

Depending on the assignment, you may have to design a task flow for a mobile and desktop application. 

A UX/UI brief can be designing a whole website as well. 

The tough thing about a short client brief is that you may not get much direction from it, and need to have more information about their values and mission to help them find the right design to communicate those to their persona. This can be a good practice in having conversations with the stakeholders. 

There will be jobs at both ends -- too much info and too little info for designers. He suggests the designer really dive into who the designs are for and what they're meant to accomplish to get at the most compelling design. 

## Class project

This is my persona for the project:

Scooter TV

Your ideal customer is a man named Leo. Leo is in their 60â€™s and is married with no children. They have a masters degree and own a small business. Leo lives in Arlington, VA, has never brought anything similar to your product before and likes to have the latest tech.

The project at the end will have something unique to this project. Decided to turn to a character generator too to get something more interesting. 

Brittney Sullivan, 98, outgoing woman
Brittney is an outgoing woman who finds it hard to do the right thing. She has crazy, black hair. Her top quality is that she is particularly naughty. She has to save the world from killer a snake.

YOu can import the task flow too. 

## Wireframes vs Hi-Fi

Wireframes are basic templates for a website, whereas high fidelity mock-ups are more put together.

A Wireframe of a task flow can be created quickly, without concern about the detailed design elements. It can also be tested quickly. 

A Wireframe should have minimal colors, one or two at the most. It's not about the color at this point, just a way to talk about the general design elements and functionalities. 

You can take things a bit further with adding a font, designing more sketch like documents that you can test with.

Once these are done, you can build a hi-fi, beautiful mockup. 

## Introducing Frames

It starts with a blank canvas.

You can start by adding a frame to the project.

A frame is like a page or interface. You can draw the frame at any size. 

To get frames that are specific to a size, use the premade frames tools. You want to pick something close enough to the specifics of the job. You can google the most common phone and desktop size and start from there too. Can be useful to know the specs of the client's tech to make sure the mockup looks great on their devices. 

You can add multiple frames to a single project, you can move then to order the frames within the project file.

Recommended that you name each frame for the number of steps in the task flow. 

You can use versioning within the document as well as in the title of the figma project, or design file (a figma design file).

## The basics of Text and Fonts

There are two ways to make textboxes from the T tab:

- click box: this will allow for free text, with no box limits.
- click and drag box: this will form a box in which the text will be in, and will not adjust to the text.


Note: At the wireframe stage, make sure to keep all wording as simple as you can, so that the testing is focused, and the reviewers don't focus on the wrong things. 

Sometimes in Figma undo doesn't quite work effectively, so you want to make sure you select the object you want to undo when you hit the command.

If you are picking a font size, there are ways to get a preview of the font on the device screen to really judge this well. an alternative is to set the zoom of the design file to 100% before judging any font size. 

When doing wireframes pick the planest fonts you can thing of. The ones will little personality and are professional and have no brush script:

- Roboto is possibly the most generic to use. 
- Arial and Calibri are too microsoft-y to be seen as generic.


If you have it include the logo of the application in black and white in your wireframe. 

Do a bit of design in the wireframe, but not an excessive amount -- mainly this should include the object placement. 

## Rectangles, Circles, and Rounded Corners

You can use the rectangles and other shapes from the shapes menu. 

You can Layer shapes as well.

There are also shortcuts for several of these features that can be learned. 

There's also an arrange menu in the Figma file menu. You can use send forward and send backward. 

## Additional Notes

After watching for a bit, I left off taking notes for each section, and just followed the demo. This section will capture one off notes I could stand to remember.

- light blue or grey are good color choices for wireframes, along with black or white. Can add a single color just for popo if those are known for the client. 
- you can choose the formatting that the color are displayed in. These options include hexadecimal, css (rgba), and other options.
- There's an eyedropper tool for color as well. 
- There's also a document color tool that keeps references to all the colors used in the current project file. 
- There's a set default properties menu in the paid version of Figma, which can enable you to set a default for different shapes (i.e. whether or not they start with a border, what colors shapes start, etc.)
- You can copy properties from each shape and paster those properties onto another using the edit menu as well by using the figma menu or Control+shift+c and -v. 
- The shortcut control+D will redo the very last thing you did, which is really helpful when making multiple copies of the same shape.
- Remember that when you build an icon, you do this from 100% zoom, so that you get a sense of how big these icons will be on screen.
- The hamburger menu is also called a `nav sandwich`
- Frames are a way to control how contents are clipped to avoid having images outside of borders. 
    - Frames are just like groups except with additional features, and many advance developers stop using groups entirely.
    - These frames can be used to develop specific parts of the wireframe in detail, to keep the other content from being moved or changed.
        - like designing the nav bar specifically without changing other parts. 
    - Frames also can have constraints for where items belong in the frame, so you can adjust easily to bigger and smaller screen sizes. 
- Frames can be used as a screen size for content, and also for frames that are taking the place of groups in the screen size.
- SVG is better phot quality than PNG, but is more complicated. You can get a good quality PNG, but it will be a much larger file. It's much more easy to use the svg in professional design. 
    - the SVG version can be made transparent by removing the frame, and the SVG file is scalable, it can be colored, and can also be adjusted in Figma to make them a custom symbol. 
- There's also a Figma community that includes icons and other things. You will have to do more searching to find good stuff in the Figma community. Also, you will end up downloading things from the Figma community, which is called duplicating. this saves a copy of the project to your figma flow. The duplicates then are saved into your drafts. In Figma, everything you duplicate or create is saved in the cloud. You'll need to keep your workspace clean and organized to keep track of files, because you will pull in many other projects. 
    - these additional icons get copied into working projects as an asset. 
    - you want to detach the instance using the right-click menu. 
- when you bring in icons, they may have different stroke values or other properties, and there are ways to make these additional icons look consistent. 
    - the stroke size of the SVG depends on the last stroke size you used. 
- Figma plug-ins can be installed, and these are a way to extending figma. There's an icon plug-in, but there are others that extend what figma can do. They have click and drop user interfaces to pull from the items. 
- When you use a plug-in, it can be easier to drag the item into the project outside of a frame, so that you can deal with the size of it and its frame before adding it to your design.
- You can use pages to separate content. You can organize these pages as mobile vs. desktop designs, or possibly to have each common frame in a separate page.   Also can be helpful to keep your task flow and user persona in a separate page in the project.
- UI Kits are design systems to stay within the design framework of a full site. A style guide is a less detailed UI kit. Pages are used to organize these systems for ease of use by others.
- 15 or 16 point fonts are best for mobile apps. 11 or 12 point fonts will feel small on mobile devices and desktops. 
- use the Figma app for testing out the mobile design on an actual device to make sure it presents well. If you don't like it on your phone, change it. 


## Designing responsive websites in Figma

a website is a collection of content for a person or organization that is published on the web, and you need a browser to access it.

When you get to the browser, you type in the domain name to get to the website. 

You can access websites from different devices as well. 

At this stage, there are two types of websites:

- porfolio websites: 
    - these are normal websites; sites you go on to read about information. These are like market sites, splash pages, wiki pages, etc. 
- website applications: web apps; these are the types of websites you interact with for results. There is an application built in that gets data from the user and gives users results based on the data provided. 

### Jakob's principle

This is a principle of design: since users go to other sites, it's best to design your website like websites the users are used to. 

This means a shopping site should be similar to other shopping web applications that already exist. Since the users are already used to websites where they buy items, so that they don't have to learn a new workflow. s

Most people don't want to learn a new workflow to do a familiar task. 

These can be slightly different, but should maintain similar patterns of commonly browsed websites so that the user experience isn't a pain point. The experience is similar, so the app is easy to use. 

First thing to do when designing a web app is to design things like web sites that serve a similar function. This means you'll have a site that's more friendly for users. Do the same thing for portfolio websites too. 

Model the design to look like popular websites.

This has an effect on your users that is understated, but completely noticeable when its wrong. 

### Styles and Components

#### Styles

This is the appearance pattern used for the design of the website or the application. The effects, the buttons, etc. You need to design these first before making the full website design, because it will help you maintain consistency. 

This should include color, button design, card design, hover effects, onclick effects, transitions, etc. 

These don't have to always be the same, but they need to be consistent -- you can have multiple effects as long as the design is appealing. 

The font families, sizes, styling, line height, letter spaces, etc. need to be consistent. 

Once these choices are made, you should save them in a style library. 

The photos and images used in the site should also be consistent with the style guide. 

#### Components

Components are portions of your website. These aren't the whole website, but small parcels that are separated by styles. 

You can bring components together to make the whole website.

With components, you can easily fix and update the components separately, without having to change the entire website. 

#### Styles in Figma

You can use the design tab to create an object in Figma, and then, when you look at the Fill section, there is a create style button.

This will bring up a prompt to create a new style. You can name these styles, then create the style.

When you create a style, you have saved it to your style library. You can save these for different objects in your design. 

You can create a color for the text, and for anything else.

To confirm the styles have been saved, you can click in an empty space to see your available styles. 

You can also create text styles too. 

You can use color styles in your design by clicking on an element then using the same button in the fill menu to choose the color style. This helps you maintain the consistency on the site design. 

In real life, you'll have several design colors in your palette. 

This is helpful, because when you are having a design review, you can adjust the color from the style library instead of changing them object by object. This keeps the whole design process synced. 

You can delete styles by clicking it and hitting delete. 

#### Text Styles

To create a type of text that'll be used for a specific component, you can specify the text size, the boldness, letter spacing, line height, etc. once the settings are acceptable, you can select the text box and go to the Text menu and click on the button (same patter as in the fill menu) and select save the style and name it. 

You can use this the same way you use the color styles.

#### Creating One Component

Example is creating a button component. 

Started with the text, then used the text style for buttons. 

hold the shift key and the A key to create an auto-layout frame for the text. You can then align the text to the center of the frame, and also set the padding spacing. You can then give the frame a color, and then color the text again for contrast. 

Can add rounded corners to the button. 

Once created and designed, you can select the diamond of circles in the top of the Figma screen to create the button as a component. This will save the object as a component. 

You can see the saved components in the assets tab in the left hand menu. this is where you can grab the button component to use. Don't use the master component, the object the component is built from, but grab child components from the asset menu. You can edit the text of the component in the child component.

You can change the text and color of the child buttons to maintain the shape, padding, and other features of the buttons. 

You don't have to change the master component every time unless you want to affect every child component. If you want to change only one child component, just un-bind the color component in the design menu. 

## Component Variants

When you make one component, you use the create component button.

But, if you want to create another version of the button with additional or different features, you can duplicate the buttons, and then add the effects/changes to the other copies of the component. 

Maybe you need to have an inactive button view, or an outline button instead of a full color button. When that happens, you just need to re-name each of the frames of the button, and then use the same button at the top of the screen to create each as a different component because of the unique names. 

If you want to have 12 versions of one component, Figma gives you the ability to create component variants.

You start from the first version, and then go to the variants section of the design tab. This will add a variant of the button component, which will add a duplicate item below the master component. You have to change the variants slightly from the master to make sure they are saved. 

Using these variants, you can create as many variations as you need. 

All the components are kept within the same master component frame. 

Once you have the number of duplicates you need, you can start changing each of the components.

You can even add properties to the variants by clicking the three dot menu on the variants tab. These properties will vary between the duplicates. 

You can use the property name to give each variant a name, then you can add the state property to note which state the variant represents, and even add a description to really detail when the variant should be used. 

## Creating Layouts

There are layout templates already available in Figma to pull from in the frame menu. These are the blank screens we can work from.

Once you have a layout selected you can use the design tab to find the place to add a layout grid. 

These grids help to maintain spacing in your design. 

You can change the grid size by clicking on the layout grid options button. The default grid size is 8px, red color, and an opacity of 10%. 

The grid also allows you to know the exact margin size between elements in the design. 

When you want to view the layout without the grid, there's a make grid invisible button (the open eye next to the grid layout options)

The grid has the option to become a column grid as well. Keep this set to stretch, which is a property to make the columns responsive to different sizes. 

There is also an overall margin space of your layout, to give spacing between the content and the side of the browser. This defines what is called the container of the design. THis is a common design pattern nowadays. 

The margin size of the container may vary between sites, but it is consistent from the top to the bottom of the website. 

The column grid can help you define the margin space of the container. The columns can be meant to stay in the container of the layout, and there is an option to choose the margin size of the container in the column grid properties. This property will add edge spaces to the columns that exist. 

There's also a `cutter` property that defines the whitespace in between the columns.

You can use the grid to make sure the alignment and size of objects are exactly the same to make objects consistent in your design. 

You should avoid using your own discretion for defining the margin between objects so that you can tell developers exactly what the spacing is. 

You can set up row grids to have these on top of the column grid. This grid has the same properties as the column grid. 

For the row grid, they recommend keeping the spacing between the rows as multiples of 8px (so 8,16,24,32,64,etc). 

Then you can make the grids invisible to evaluate the designs without the grids. 


### Responsive Design

Its important to design your website with all sizes of screen in mind, especially mobile, because a lot of people will be using phones to access these pages.

There's a device toggle tool in the inspect panel in chrome. This will allow you to see how a website looks on different screens. 

One of the key changes between the screen sizes is the margin of the container. Thats because a desktop screen has a lot more side space than a mobile screen.

For Mobile designs, the site may stack things vertically that used to be in a row, or reduce navigation links into a hamburger menu. 

this is called responsive design -- the design is consistent from screen to screen and adjusts to acount for the size of the screen the site. Always be more concerned by the width of the site than the height of the site, because the width is what changes drastically from screen to screen.

The screen toggle button has several options much like figma.


## Design Systems

This is a combination of the style library and the component library. In design systems there may be additional documentation, tokens, stickers, or other things, but the core pieces are the components and the style library.

One of the ways designers follow Jakob's principle is to build designs starting from a style library. One popular style library is the material UI library.

A syle library is made up of:

- shadow styles
- grid styles
- color styles 
- text styles

You can create your own style library based on the material design library. 

There are 3 versions of the Material design guide. 

### Defining Shadow styles

You can pick any shape, with any color, and then use them to define the shadow style with these shapes being in a frame. 

You can search for these styles in the material.io documentation. 

There are a number of shadows defined, and you can import these into a Figma project.

The different shadow styles are defined by the dp elevation. You can choose any of the dp elevations that you want, and you can try them out. 

Once you add a shadow to an object in Figma, you can set the properties to the same values in the material.io documentation to match their shadow effect.

### Defining Grid Styles

These are useful for navigating different display layouts. 

You do this by making a frame at the size you want, then add a layout grid with the styles in the `adaptive design` section in the material.io documentation. 

Look at hte responsive layout grid, and it will tell you what size you should use for the margins columns and gutters. 

The breakpoint range defines the width values for different display sizes. These breakpoints are the pixel sizes of the width of the display. 

This table defines the number of columns you should use for that frame, and the size of the margins for the frame you are designing.

you can multiply the suggested margin by any integer to change the width to different sizes, but its recommended to follow what's provided. 

You'll go to `responsive design` to find the breakpoint table for the gutter specifications.

There is no row grid design guides, because the width is more important to adjust in responsive design, way more important than the heights. 

The instructor's settings for row grids are:

- count: 800
- type: center
- color: black
- opacity: 20%
- gutter: 0
- hieght: 8

You can save the combination of the row and column grid styles as a single grid layout for the device you want to work on. 

Repeat this process for the desktop, tablet, and phone display sizes. 

Use the `W` property in the frame design tab to figure out what breakpoints to use from the design guide. 

You should define a grid layout for each of the breakpoint sizes in the material design guide. 

Once you save the layout grid, you can then add the layout grid as a starting point for another frame to start designing a diffferent page of the website or mobile app. 

you can even stretch the height of the frame with the layout grid to better suit the display you are designing for. 

### Color System

A color system is divided into two sets:

- key colors
    - accent colors
    - neutral colors
- tonal palettes

The key colors have the two subcategories above. Under the accent color there are primary, secondary, and tertiary key color.

There are two neutral key colors (primary and secondary).

The accent primrary key color is defined to be used in certain elements in the page, and this is used for prominent features in your page. 

Each color has a role it serves, and the material design guide gives you the elements of the page that should be colored with specific colors.

The idea is that you'll need at least five colors to build your website.

There is also instructions for colors to use when elements are on top of the other colors, like buttons sitting on top of container/background colors. These are called roles. 

For each of the colors you want to create:

- the main color for a container
- the color for an icon on top of the main color
- a secondary container color
- the color for an icon on top of the secondary container

This is for each of the accent colors, and the neutral colors. 

The on-top-of color schemes should be in contrast to the container color scheme.
