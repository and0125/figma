learning UI/UX design with the Figma design tool


## Selection Concepts

selection is the bulk of the design process. This is selecting an object to be further designed/customized. 

The first thing to modify an object in figma is to select the object.

Two types of selection tools, and these work on any object in the design:

- move: 
    - selects objects in the design by clicking. You can confirm an object is selected by the highlighting around the edges of the object. Only when an object is selected in this way can it be designed (colored, edited, etc.).

Vector selection is an advanced use of selection, which happens when you have an object selected and then press the enter key. Vector mode allows for more customization of the selected object. You can alternate between vector and normal selection mode by pressing the enter key. You can also use the blue done button to transition between the selection modes as well.

having an object in normal selection mode has limited design features, but vector selection has more editing features.

The course will show when vector selection is necessary, and when normal selection mode is fine.
